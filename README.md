## Data Professionals Survey Dashboard
This is a guided project in which a dashboard is created using the survey data of data professionals, entirely in Power BI.  
The data contains the answers given by data professionals for different questions asked in the survey.  
Data was loaded, transformed and visualised using Power BI.  
* Transformation was done in power query editor which included deleting unwanted columns, replacing values in existing columns, splitting columns using delimiter and adding new columns.
* Explicit measures were created to calculate the average salary, average salary rating and average work/life balance rating.
* Visualizations used in the dashboard include treemap, column chart, gauge chart, stacked column chart, donut chart, bar chart and cards.

This project was done with the help of Alex Freberg by following his videos in the youtube channel 'Alex The Analyst'.
