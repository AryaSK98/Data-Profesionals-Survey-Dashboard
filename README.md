The data contains the answers given by data professionals for different questions asked on a survey.  
Data is loaded, transformed and visualised using Power BI.  
* Transformation was done in power query editor which included deleting unwanted columns, replacing values in existing columns, splitting columns using delimiter and adding new columns.
* Explicit measures were created to calculate the average salary, average salary rating and average work/life balance rating.
